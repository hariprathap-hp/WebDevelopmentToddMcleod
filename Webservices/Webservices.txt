SOAP based webservices
	-> SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured data that’s defined in XML
	
REST:
	-> Representational State Transfer
	-> REST, which stands for Representational State Transfer, is a framework for developing APIs
	
	-> Also refer the APIs vs Microservices link to know more about REST APIs
	
APIs:
	-> In microservices approach every piece of software is small enough to focus on a single purpose and big enough to add value as a component. All software components are responsible for different, but well-encapsulated domain areas, and they communicate with each-other using an API
	
What is a Web-API?
	-> Web APIs facilitate communication between web servers
	-> A Web-API is an external API 
	
Internal APIs:
	-> Internal APIs are used for communication within an application, and access is usually restricted to the organization’s employees and authorized developers

Section 3; Testig in Go
	-> Types : Unit,Integeration and Function
	
	->Go doesn't have assertions 
		-> Why? For example, if there are 2-3 conditions that needed to be asseted mandatorily and using assert statement will exit if the first condition fails
		-> But, using go Tests, even if the first condition fails, we can proceed to check if the remaining conditions succeed or not
		
	-> Can we use assertion in Go?
		-> Yes, using assert package from strectchr
				-> assert package helps proceed with asserion even when the first assertion fails
				
	-> How to run test coverage?
		-> go test -cover
